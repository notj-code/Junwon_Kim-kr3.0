# Problem

> There are `n` applicants and $m$ free apartments. Your task is to distribute the apartments so that as many applicants as possible will get an apartment. Each applicant has a desired apartment size, and they will accept any apartment whose size is close enough to the desired size.


- __Input__: 
The first input line has three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`: the number of applicants, the number of apartments, and the maximum allowed difference.
The next line contains n integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`: the desired apartment size of each applicant. If the desired size of an applicant is `x`, he or she will accept any apartment whose size is between `x-k` and `x+k$`
The last line contains $m$ integers `b_1`, `b_2`, ... , `b_m`: the size of each apartment.


- __Output__:
Print one integer: the number of applicants who will get an apartment.


## Sample Input, Output
```cpp
Sample Input:
4 3 5
60 45 80 60
30 60 75

Sample Output:

# Implementation

Variables used for the current problem:
 - `n`: number of applicants

 - `m`: number of apartments

 - `k`: max diff between desired and actual size

 - `a` and `b`: arrays for applicants and apartments respectively
 

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

const int MAX_N = 2e5;

int n, m, k, a[MAX_N], b[MAX_N], ans;

void solve() {
	cin >> n >> m >> k;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) cin >> a[i];
	for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) cin >> b[i];
	sort(a, a + n);
	sort(b, b + m);
	int i = 0, j = 0;
	while (i < n && j < m) {
		// Found a suitable apartment for the applicant
		if (abs(a[i] - b[j]) <= k) {
			++i;
			++j;
			++a;
		} else {
			// If the desired apartment size of the applicant is too big,
			// move the apartment pointer to the right to find a bigger one
			if (a[i] - b[j] > k) {
				++j;
			}
			// If the desired apartment size is too small,
			// skip that applicant and move to the next person
			else {
				++i;
			}
		}
	}
	cout << ans << "\n";
}

int main() {
	ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
	cin.tie(nullptr);
	solve();
	return 0;
}

```
