I was raised in Korea, but now I live and study in Qingdao, China.\n\nPreviously, I enjoyed **competitive programming**, solving problems algorithmically with C/C++. I also **founded a Competitive Programming Club and AI Hackathon** in my high school. I organized events, **developed a school online judge (wboj.app)**, and created algorithm problems.\n\nI spent one summer as a **software engineering intern at Smooth**, where I **developed a launch pad platform and a smart contract** for the Sepolia test network.\n\nNow, I'm currently focusing on **machine learning, computer vision, image processing, and cloud computing**. I'm thinking about how to **process large data like images or videos with fewer resources** for both clients and service providers.\n\nWhen I'm not doing the above, I usually take photos, play my guitar, or work out at a gym.","resume":{"tagline":"ðŸ‘‹  I'm a Korean student which currently study abroad to Qingdao, China.","description":"Previously, I enjoyed **competitive programming**, solving problems algorithmically with C/C++.\n\nNow, I'm currently focusing on **machine learning**, **computer vision**, **image processing**, and **cloud computing**.
